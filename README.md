# dog-breed-classofocation-model-using-CNN-
The problem of dog breed classification is a famous problem in machine learning and deep learning 
.the problem is about predicting the breed of a dog after from it is image if we were given an image of a dog and predicting the resembling
dog breed if we were given a picture of human .the project is multi-class classification project in which we are going to use supervised learning 
.in the project I am going to use CNN (conventional neural network) to solve it .I choose this project because I want to go deeper in deep learning and neural network
